## sysadmin by day, superhero by night[^1]

### About me
_Husband and proud father; sysadmin, geek, tinkerer, rugby fan, dreamer, coca-cola drinker, OpenSource passionate._

<img align="right" src="/images/me.png" alt="Marco GarcÃªs">
Very soon in my life, I was interested in computer science and IT in general, and when I found GNU/Linux and OpenSource (when I was a teenager), I was hooked for life. 
Since then, I have been passionate about learning and improving my knowledge about OpenSource operating systems, and all the software that surrounds it. I'm also a big supporter of OpenSource projects, like WiKipedia, OpenStreetMaps or electronics platform Arduino.

I'm a **SYSADMIN** at my core, but I also love to code stuff to solve problems. Hacking and tinkering is in my nature, and when I need to solve a challenge, I never give up!

The datacenter is my happy place, and I live on the command line. I feel motivated has the projects in my life, get bigger and bigger, and I'm always ready for new challenges.

On the last few years I became an expert on RedHat's technologies, and developed a love affair with sysmonitoring OpenSource systems like Nagios/Icinga. I also have a growing appetite for clustering and distributed computing, and high-availability technologies.

Currently living in Maputo/Mozambique, working for the largest bank in Mozambique, BCI; Next month I will be moving to Cape Town/South Africa, and start working for the largest cloud provider in the world...
